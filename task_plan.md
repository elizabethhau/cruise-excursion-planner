# Task Plan — Cruise Excursion Planner

## Goal
Build `cruise-planner.html`: a self-contained single HTML file (no build step, no framework) that 7 family members can open on mobile to vote on RSSC shore excursions. Votes persist to Google Sheets. Elizabeth (trip organizer) can lock bookings; others vote and request.

## Decisions Log (from grill-me session)

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Hosting | GitHub Pages (stable HTTPS, OAuth redirect URI compatible) |
| OAuth flow | Google OAuth Client ID + API Key + Spreadsheet ID; stored in localStorage |
| Activity levels | Infer from PDF text, flag ALL 88 for manual review by user |
| Ages | Everyone 21+ — no age restriction UI needed |
| Hobart excursions | 1 only (HBA-013) |
| Sheets polling | 30s foreground-only; pause on `visibilitychange` |
| Navigation | Bottom tab bar: Vote · Dashboard · Schedule · Settings |
| Non-Elizabeth dashboard | Same view as Elizabeth; Lock controls + tappable badge breakdown + "Ports ready to book" + Requests inbox HIDDEN |
| Voting requirement | At least 1 love/interested per port = "complete" (skip-only doesn't count) |
| Melbourne date nav | Single scrollable card list; dates labeled per offering slot (no sub-tabs) |

## Phases

> **Implementation note:** Phase 3 skeleton (HTML/CSS) is written first since it's the container for all other phases, even though it's listed as Phase 3.

### Phase 1 — Excursion JSON Data
**Status:** `pending`
Build the complete JSON object for all 88 excursions / 109 offerings.
Fields per excursion: code, name, duration_hrs, price_usd, retail_price_usd, activity_level, meal_included, accessible, go_local, free_shore, description (2-3 sentences), offerings[]
Fields per offering: date (YYYY-MM-DD), departure_time (HH:MM 24h)
Flag: activity_level_needs_review: true on ALL entries.
Output: embedded as `const EXCURSION_DATA = {...}` JS constant in the HTML.

Sub-tasks:
- [x] **1a** — Melbourne (11 exc, 24 offerings) + Hobart (1 exc, 1 offering); open `const EXCURSION_DATA`
- [x] **1b** — Dunedin (11 exc, 12 offerings) + Christchurch (10 exc, 11 offerings) + Picton (8 exc, 8 offerings)
- [x] **1c** — Wellington (9 exc, 11 offerings) + Gisborne (8 exc, 10 offerings)

### Phase 8 — Conflict Engine & Offline Queue
**Status:** `pending`
- Conflict detection: for same person + same date, check departure_time + duration_hrs overlaps
- Apply at: Flow B card render, Flow C Lock pre-check, Flow D schedule render, after every sync
- Offline queue: localStorage array of pending actions; retry on reconnect; "⏳ Pending sync" badge

Sub-tasks:

### Phase 9 — Polish & Deliverables
**Status:** `pending`
- Console.log full JSON on load (for verification)
- CLAUDE.md for the repo
- Deliverable docs: Google Sheets setup steps, port-by-port summary, ambiguity log, known limitations

Sub-tasks:
- [x] **9a** — console.log EXCURSION_DATA on load; verify port/excursion/offering counts (88 exc / 109 offerings confirmed)
- [x] **9b** — Write CLAUDE.md for the repo
- [ ] **9c** — Write Google Sheets setup instructions (separate doc or in-app help modal)

### Phase 10 — Offering Selection During Voting
**Status:** `complete`

Users must pick a specific offering (date + time) when voting love/maybe on multi-offering excursions. The preference is stored alongside the vote (informational) and surfaces in the Lock Modal so Elizabeth can book the correct offering per person.

**Decisions (from grill-me session):**
- Votes sheet gets 2 new columns: `OfferingDate`, `OfferingTime`
- Selector only shown on multi-offering excursions; single-offering auto-selects silently
- Love/maybe blocked until an offering is selected; skip has no selector
- Offering persists across vote-sentiment changes (love→maybe); always editable inline
- Vote summary on card shows love/maybe counts split by offering (e.g. "❤️ Dec 31 × 2, Jan 1 × 1")
- Lock Modal shows each person's preferred offering next to their name
- Existing love/maybe votes with no offering get a subtle "pick a date ↑" nudge on the card

Sub-tasks:
- [x] **10a** — Schema + sync: add `OfferingDate`, `OfferingTime` to Votes sheet header; update `syncFromSheets` to read them into `STATE.votes[code][person]` as `{vote, offering_date, offering_time}`
- [x] **10b** — STATE.votes structure: migrate all reads of `STATE.votes[code][person]` (currently a bare string) to the new object shape `{vote, offering_date, offering_time}`; added `voteOf(code, person)` helper
- [x] **10c** — Vote card UI: inline radio buttons for multi-offering excursions; required before love/maybe is accepted; skip shows nothing; single-offering silent
- [x] **10d** — `castVote`: include `offering_date` + `offering_time` in the row appended to Sheets
- [x] **10e** — Nudge: detect love/maybe in `STATE.votes` with no `offering_date`; render "👆 Pick a date/time above" indicator
- [x] **10f** — Vote split summary: per-offering breakdown on multi-offering excursion cards (e.g. "❤️ Dec 31 8:00 AM ×2")
- [x] **10g** — Lock Modal: show `"→ Dec 31 · 8:00 AM"` (or "no pref") next to each person's name in the people-selection list

### Phase 11 — Undo Vote (Persist to Sheets)
**Status:** `complete`

Toggle-to-undo logic already existed in `handleVote` (line 2388) but only cleared local STATE — never wrote to Sheets. After sync, the vote returned.

**Decisions (from grill-me session):**
- Sentinel value: `''` (empty string) — `voteOf()` already returns `null` for `'' || null`, so no downstream rendering changes needed
- Sheets load loop overwrites by row order (newest wins), so a later `''` row correctly cancels an earlier `'love'` row
- Toast: `showToast('Vote removed')` for feedback
- Scope: voting view only

Sub-tasks:
- [x] **11a** — `handleVote` undo branch: add `await castVote(code, '', null, null)` + `showToast('Vote removed')`
